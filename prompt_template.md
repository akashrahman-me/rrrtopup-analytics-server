Follow our architecture to implement ButcherCookScreen.

Have a title `‡¶ï‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶ì ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ö‡¶ø`

then have a cards section with those card data `[
{
"emoji": "üêÑ",
"name": "‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶≤ ‡¶á‡¶∏‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶Æ",
"number": "01709158834",
"address": "‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ü ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∞",
"type": "‡¶ï‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶á"
},

]
`
this card thumbnail will never full width, and this card will be in defferent styles. however, this card section should have a select option so that user can select it type. in additinality it will have a search option where user can search by name, address or type.

Design it ultra-modern, professional, minimalistic, visually clean with smooth spacing, consistent typography, clear hierarchy, and intuitive navigation.

Use Material Icons where possible and reuse existing components when available.
